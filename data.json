Solskjaer is hoping that Pogba can provide some creative spark and help link up with the forwards to create more chances.The other change could be in defense, where Victor Lindelof could replace Eric Bailly to provide more stability at the back. Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are expected to retain their places in the full-back positions. Up front, Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani are set to start, while Mason Greenwood could replace Bruno Fernandes in the attacking midfield role.Overall, Solskjaer will be looking to strike a balance between defense and attack, and ensure that his team is able to control the game and create opportunities.

        "title": "Chelsea's Starting Lineup Changes Ahead of Premier League Game: Injury Woes and Tactical Decisions",
        "body": "The latest team news for Chelsea is in ahead of their upcoming Premier League game, and it includes a few changes to the starting lineup. Two changes are forced on Frank Lampard due to injuries, while the other two are tactical.Firstly, Kai Havertz will miss the game due to a knee problem, which means Raheem Sterling will replace him in attack. It's always disappointing for a manager to lose a player to injury, especially one as talented as Havertz, but Lampard will have confidence in Sterling's ability to step up and make a difference. Secondly, Reece James has been ruled out for the rest of the season after suffering a hamstring injury in the previous game against Real Madrid. This means Cesar Azpilicueta will return to skipper the side on his first appearance since going off with a head injury against Southampton more than two months ago. Ben Chilwell will come in for Marc Cucurella on the left wing.In midfield, Enzo Fernandez and Mateo Kovacic will continue their partnership, while Conor Gallagher and N'Golo Kante will both retain their places from last week's Champions League tie against Real Madrid. These are all strong midfield options for Chelsea, and Lampard will be hoping they can dominate the middle of the park and control the game.Finally, the back three of Wesley Fofana, Thiago Silva, and Trevoh Chalobah ahead of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga will remain unchanged. This backline has been solid for Chelsea in recent games, and Lampard will be looking for them to keep a clean sheet and provide a platform for his attacking players to create chances.Overall, while there are a few changes to the starting lineup, Lampard will be confident in his team's ability to get a result. The players coming in are experienced and talented, and the ones retaining their places have already shown they can perform at the highest level. It's an exciting time for Chelsea fans, and they will be hoping for another strong performance from their team.",
